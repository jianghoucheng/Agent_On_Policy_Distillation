Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we note that the problem requires a bipartite perfect matching between rows and columns. Each row must be monochromatic (all white or all black), and each column must be monochromatic. Additionally, the placement must satisfy the constraints that any extra chip would violate the color uniformity in rows or columns.\n\nTo model this, we can represent the grid as a bipartite graph with 5 rows and 5 columns. Each valid placement corresponds to a perfect matching where each row and column is fully colored. The constraints ensure that any additional chip would create a conflict, meaning that the graph must be a complete bipartite graph \\(K_{5,5}\\), where every row is connected to every column via edges of the same color.\n\nGiven that a perfect matching in \\(K_{5,5}\\) is a bijection between the rows and columns, each consisting entirely of white or black chips, the number of such matchings is equal to the number of perfect matchings in \\(K_{5,5}\\). For a complete bipartite graph \\(K_{n,n}\\), the number of perfect matchings is \\(n!\\) if the graph is a complete graph.
